# Regular-Expression-Engine-In-OCaml

## About The Project

The overall purpose of the program is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge with functional programming languages such OCaml. The program implements algorthims that work with DFAs (Deterministic Finite Automata), NFAs (Nondeterministic Finite Automata), and regular expressions. The project is broken into three parts: algorithms on NFAs; converting a DFA to an NFA; and converting/working with Regular Expressions. In the first part of the program a NFA is simulated. Part II a NFA to DFA converter is implemented. Part III regular expressions are convernted to an NFA. These three parts are put together to create an Interpreter.
